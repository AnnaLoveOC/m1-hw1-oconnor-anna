I have some experience working with basic web tools like HTML and CSS, and I’m continuing to learn more as I go. Most of my coding experience so far has come from undergraduate graphic design classes and small projects, where I’ve been getting comfortable with the basics and understanding how design and code connect.

## Career Goals
